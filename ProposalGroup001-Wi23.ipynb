    "\n",
    "Our goal is to design and execute a machine-learning model that estimates room occupancy based on temperature, light, sound, CO2, and digital passive infrared (PIR) data. We will use data provided by UCI, which consists of 10,129 instances and 16 attributes. The data was collected in a 6m - 4.6m room with seven sensor nodes and one edge node in a star configuration. The sensor nodes transmit data every 30 seconds using wireless transceivers to measure temperature, light, sound, CO2, and PIR. To solve this problem, we will use Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM. As the data is already clean and preprocessed, we will apply the SVM model as it does not make any assumptions about the data. The algorithm will fit the optimal hyperplane between the two classes with the help of support vectors. To measure performance/success, we will use F1-score and confusion matrix evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. By executing this project, we hope to accurately estimate room occupancy, which can be used to optimize energy consumption and improve building management."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing smart and energy-efficient buildings. One important aspect of building management is the efficient use of resources, including energy consumption. Occupancy-based control is a popular strategy for optimizing energy usage in buildings. By accurately estimating the number of occupants in a room, building managers can adjust heating, cooling, and lighting systems to meet the occupants' needs while minimizing energy waste. \n",
    "Research on occupancy-based control using machine learning has been active in recent years. Many studies have proposed and evaluated various models and algorithms for predicting occupancy based on sensor data. For instance, the study conducted by Wang et al. (2019) <a name=\"cite1\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580518302656\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> used SVM and Random Forest models to estimate occupancy based on temperature and humidity sensor data. The study carried out a 30-day experiment in a library and utilized data mining techniques to model occupancy patterns. As a result, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems were able to achieve better performance. Another research is from Adarsh et al. (2020)<a name=\"cite2\" href=\"https://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/view_publication/mastersthesis/872\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> that studies the sensor data analytics and data reduction techniques. The research discussed occupancy estimation using ML, analysis of ML algorithms from the perspective of constrained microcontrollers, and ML-based data transmission reduction for occupancy applications. \n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that accurately estimates and predicts the number of people in a room using a dataset collected at different times throughout 4 days from various types of sensors, including those that detect temperature, light, sound, CO2, and PIR, respectively. It’s contributional in solving the task of monitoring room occupancy in real-time. To achieve this goal, our machine learning algorithm, based on the methods of logistic regression or decision trees, will be trained and tested using a large dataset of sensor measurements collected from real-world scenarios."

The ground-truth value of a number of occupancies is also included. The variables listed below are considered to be critical, and they are represented in terms of numerical values with units labeled: temperature in degrees Celsius, light in Lux, sound in Volts (read by ADC devices), and Carbon Dioxide in PPM.\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A tentative solution to solve this problem is to adopt a decision tree classification model.The decision tree works by splitting on available features and using greedy search to find the best split which will maximize entropy gain and create the most homogenous splits. We use decision trees because decision trees have good interpretability. We know the exact parameters at each split and we can tell which variable contributes more to the final decision. This information is useful because, in real life, we don't want to have too many sensors in one room just for predicting how many people are in a room due to cost considerations. Finding which sensor contributes most to prediction can help us reduce the number of unnecessary sensors.More importantly, since we are interested in predicting the number of people in our room, we want our model to classify our data points into 4 different categories and generate 4 different labels representing the number of people in the room.(Room with 0 people, room with 1 person, room with 2 people, and room with 3 people).Therefore, using a decision tree, capable of separating multiple classes and outputting multiple labels at one time, will be a good option. The nature of our dataset also suggests using a Decision tree.By inspecting our dataset, it looks like most of our variables are sensor measurements which are numerical and different measurements, such as light measurement and temperature measurement, seem to have quite different ranges and don’t seem like they are normalized previously. Therefore, by using a decision tree, which is a nonparametric approach, we don’t need to worry about normalizations. The sklearn document suggests that the inbound sklearn class DecisionTreeClassifier utilizes the CART tree, which only supports numerical data. Therefore, as our measurements are numerical, we can easily implement a decision tree just using basic sklearn and we are almost guaranteed success on model creation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the benchmark model, we propose using Random Forest, which is similar to decision trees but needs more time to train as it combines the result of multiple decision trees and Random Forest typically achieves better performance than a single tree. By implementing the Random Forest algorithm, we want to figure out if it's worth spending extra time to train for the Random Forest by comparing the performance of two models.\n",

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are doing a data classification, which is a classification problem, then the most appropriate error metrics are related to how many classifications we made on the test data are right or not; in other words, we have to avoid misclassification as much as possible. As we will use logistic regression in our model to predict the probability of data containing 0,1,2,3 people in total. We are going to use the recall: which is the true positive rate, which is the P(detect positive | true positive), and this equals to P(detect positive and true positive)/P(true positive), and we want this probability as closer to one as possible for a good model. Another error metric we use is the specificity, which calculates the probability of having correct negative labels. Mathematically,  P(detect negative | true negative), which is equivalent to P(detect negative and true negative)/P(true negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to maximize the presicion since we care a lot if a person detected positive is positive. But in our case, we don’t have special weight on either side of the positive/negative, this is why we care about the both true posibve rate and true negative rate equally. We will use these metrics into either One vs One or One vs Rest to validate if our model is solid. "

    "One ethical problem it may raise is that it is the case the people who don’t move will highly likely be ignored by the motion detector.

This may seem offensive to them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have to think about security issues: when bad thieves use our model to detect how many people are there in an apartment, it may give them ideas about when to come in.
